# CTSP
Colored Traveling salesman problem
In order to solve the Coloured Travelling Salesman Problem (CTSP), a challenging
variation of the standard Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), the project successfully
applied and tested an Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. By including numerous
salesman (colours) and exclusive as well as shared cities, the CTSP adds another level
of complexity, making it a more difficult and applicable problem for real-world logistics
and routing scenarios.
The created ABC method balances exploration and exploitation by using binary

tournament selection to keep neighbouring solutions explored and by repeatedly im-
proving solutions through exploration.
